# Prompts Used During Development

## Initial Exploration
"Help me implement ByteSize and TimeDuration parsers for CDAP Wrangler to handle units like KB, MB, ms, s, etc. Please explore the codebase to understand the structure."

## Grammar and TokenType Implementation
"Implement the grammar changes for ByteSize and TimeDuration tokens in Directives.g4 and update TokenType.java to include these new token types."

## Token Classes Implementation
"Implement the ByteSize.java class that implements the Token interface to handle byte sizes with units like KB, MB, etc."

"Implement the TimeDuration.java class that implements the Token interface to handle time durations with units like ms, s, m, etc."

## Parser Rule Implementation
"Update the RecipeVisitor.java to handle the new ByteSize and TimeDuration tokens during parsing."

## Test Implementation
"Create parser tests for ByteSize and TimeDuration tokens in RecipeCompilerTest.java to ensure tokens are correctly parsed."

"Create a test class to validate the ByteSize and TimeDuration token classes."

"Implement tests for the AggregateStats directive that uses the new tokens."

## Documentation
"Update the README.md to document the new ByteSize and TimeDuration parsers."

## Fix Issues
"Fix the linter errors in AggregateStatsTest.java to properly use TestingRig."
